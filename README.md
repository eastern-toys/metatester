# metatester
A bit of Javascript for interactively testing metapuzzles.

Use these files as a starting point when uploading your metapuzzle to
Puzzletron.

1. Download these files (by using the Download ZIP button on Github and
   unzipping the zip file, or by cloning the git repository).
2. Edit index.html to contain the answers that feed into the metapuzzle, as
   well as any other information / shell materials needed to solve the
   metapuzzle. You may include images and other resources by copying them into
   the same folder as index.html and referring to them within index.html (using
   img tags or links, for example).
3. Zip up index.html and all of its resources (including the metatester files,
   and any other resources you've added) into a single zip file. Make sure that
   index.html is at the top level of the zip file - it can't be within a folder
   within the zip file.
4. Upload the zip file to a Puzzletron puzzle as a draft.
